Notes

React app with Redux

___

You can add your own notes and tag your keywords with hashtags.<br/> 
In the future, you will be able to find your note by ***#hashTag*** if you enter a keyword in the search box above the notes block.<br/>
When you click on the __*edit*__ button, you enter the edit mode and can add a #hash to the word. After clicking on the problem, the word automatically goes to the block with tags under the entry field of the note.<br/>
You can also add a tag without including the edit mode.<br/>
>Note that you can only delete tags from a note in edit mode.
> 
You can launch applications using the `dev` command in npm scripts or command `yarn start dev`
Words that match the tags will be highlighted in the note text input field.
